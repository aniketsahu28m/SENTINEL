# Test IPs for Sentinel System

## Benign IPs (Known Safe)

1. Internal Network IPs:
- 127.0.0.1 (localhost - Always safe for testing)
- 192.168.1.1 (Common router IP)
- 10.0.0.1 (Common internal network)
- 172.16.0.1 (Common private network)

2. Known Public Services:
- 8.8.8.8 (Google DNS - Known safe)
- 1.1.1.1 (Cloudflare DNS - Known safe)
- 208.67.222.222 (OpenDNS - Known safe)

3. Major Cloud Providers (Safe):
- 13.107.42.14 (Microsoft Azure)
- 16.12.42.68 (Amazon AWS)
- 34.102.136.180 (Google Cloud)

## Anomalous IPs (For Testing Alerts)

1. Known Malicious (Test with caution):
- 45.112.146.37 (Known malware distribution)
- 185.143.223.12 (Known botnet command)
- 91.234.99.87 (Known phishing host)

2. Suspicious Behavior Pattern:
- 103.91.206.72 (Unusual port scanning)
- 167.248.133.40 (Excessive connection attempts)
- 89.248.167.131 (Known for brute force attempts)

3. Geographic Anomalies (If unexpected for your network):
- 27.155.92.154 (China)
- 194.26.29.144 (Russia)
- 41.71.120.42 (Nigeria)

## Test Scenarios

1. Benign to Anomalous Transition:
- Start with 192.168.1.100 (internal)
- Switch to 45.112.146.37 (suspicious)
Expected: Should trigger new host detection and critical port alerts

2. Service Change Detection:
- Use 10.0.0.50 with standard HTTP (80)
- Change to unusual high ports (8080, 9000)
Expected: Should trigger service change alert

3. State Change Testing:
- Monitor 172.16.0.100 (initially all ports closed)
- Open ports 22, 80, 443
Expected: Should trigger state change detection

## Testing Instructions

1. Basic Test:
```python
test_targets = ["127.0.0.1", "8.8.8.8", "45.112.146.37"]
scan_args = "-sV -O -Pn"
```

2. Anomaly Detection Test:
```python
baseline_ip = "192.168.1.100"
anomaly_ip = "45.112.146.37"
critical_ports = [22, 80, 443, 3389]
```

3. Service Change Test:
```python
target_ip = "10.0.0.50"
initial_ports = "80,443"
changed_ports = "8080,9000"
```

Note: Always test in a controlled environment first. Some IPs might be blocked or unreachable depending on your network configuration.
